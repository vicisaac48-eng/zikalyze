# Sakata Methods (Sakata Goho) — Traditional Japanese Candlestick Analysis

## Overview

**Sakata Methods** (酒田五法, Sakata Goho, "Sakata's Five Methods") are traditional Japanese candlestick pattern analysis techniques that originated in the 18th century rice trading markets in Sakata, Japan. They are named after the legendary trader **Sokyu Honma (本間宗久)** who developed these methods while trading rice futures in the Dojima Rice Exchange in Osaka.

These methods predate modern Western technical analysis by over 200 years and form the foundation of candlestick charting.

## The Five Sakata Methods (Sakata Goho)

### 1. 三山 San-zan (Three Mountains)

**Type**: Top Reversal Pattern  
**Western Equivalent**: Triple Top, Head and Shoulders

**Description**:
Three peaks of similar height indicate strong resistance and potential trend reversal from uptrend to downtrend.

**Pattern Structure**:
```
      Peak2
      /\
Peak1 /  \ Peak3
    /    \/    \
   /            \
```

**Variations**:
- **三尊 (Sanzun / Three Buddha)**: When the middle peak is highest — equivalent to Head and Shoulders
- **逆三尊 (Gyaku Sanzun / Inverted Three Buddha)**: Inverted H&S pattern (bottom reversal)

**Trading Rules**:
- **Signal**: Confirmed when price breaks below the support line connecting the two valleys
- **Entry**: Break below neckline
- **Target**: Measure from head to neckline, project downward
- **Stop Loss**: Above the third peak

**Psychology**:
Buyers attempt to push higher three times but fail, exhausting bullish momentum. Sellers take control.

### 2. 三川 San-sen (Three Rivers)

**Type**: Bottom Reversal Pattern  
**Western Equivalent**: Triple Bottom, Inverted Head and Shoulders

**Description**:
Three troughs of similar depth indicate strong support and potential trend reversal from downtrend to uptrend.

**Pattern Structure**:
```
\            /
 \    /\    /
  \  /  \  /
   \/    \/
Trough1 Trough2 Trough3
```

**Variations**:
- **三川宵の明星 (Sanzen Yoi no Myojo)**: Evening Star at the third trough
- **三川明けの明星 (Sanzen Ake no Myojo)**: Morning Star at the third trough

**Trading Rules**:
- **Signal**: Confirmed when price breaks above the resistance line connecting the two peaks
- **Entry**: Break above neckline
- **Target**: Measure from the lowest trough to neckline, project upward
- **Stop Loss**: Below the third trough

**Psychology**:
Sellers attempt to push lower three times but fail, exhausting bearish momentum. Buyers take control.

### 3. 三兵 San-pei (Three Gaps)

**Type**: Gap Patterns (Breakaway, Continuation, Exhaustion)  
**Western Equivalent**: Gap Analysis

**Description**:
Three types of gaps that signal different market phases:

#### 3a. Breakaway Gap (離れ形, Hanare-gata)
- Occurs at the start of a new trend
- Large gap after consolidation
- Usually NOT filled
- High volume
- **Signal**: Strong trend beginning

#### 3b. Continuation Gap (中押し, Nakaoshi)
- Occurs mid-trend
- Moderate gap in direction of trend
- Confirms trend strength
- **Signal**: Trend continuation, halfway point

#### 3c. Exhaustion Gap (窓埋め, Mado-ume / "Window Filling")
- Occurs near end of trend
- Gap in trend direction but quickly filled
- Often followed by reversal
- Low quality, wide range candles
- **Signal**: Trend exhaustion, potential reversal

**Pattern Structure**:
```
Uptrend with Gaps:

    [Exhaustion Gap]
         ↑ (filled quickly)
    
    [Continuation Gap]
         ↑
    
[Breakaway Gap]
    ↑
[Consolidation]
```

**Trading Rules**:
- **Breakaway**: Enter in gap direction, expect trend
- **Continuation**: Add to position, expect move to continue
- **Exhaustion**: Take profits, watch for reversal
- **Gap Fill**: If continuation gap fills = warning sign

**Psychology**:
- Breakaway: Surprise move, FOMO drives participation
- Continuation: Confirmation bias, trend followers join
- Exhaustion: Late buyers, last gasp before reversal

### 4. 三法 San-poh (Three Methods)

**Type**: Continuation Patterns  
**Western Equivalent**: Flag, Pennant, Bull/Bear Flag

**Description**:
Consolidation within a trend that typically leads to continuation in the original direction. Usually consists of 3-5 small candles within the range of a large trend candle.

**Pattern Structure**:

**Rising Three Methods** (上昇三法):
```
Large Bullish
     ↑
  [3 small]
  [candles]
  [retracing]
     ↑
Large Bullish
```

**Falling Three Methods** (下降三法):
```
Large Bearish
     ↓
  [3 small]
  [candles]
  [retracing]
     ↓
Large Bearish
```

**Characteristics**:
1. Large candle in trend direction (Day 1)
2. Three or more small candles that retrace (Days 2-4)
   - Stay within Day 1's range
   - Ideally opposite color to trend
3. Final large candle breaks out in trend direction (Day 5)

**Trading Rules**:
- **Entry**: Break of final consolidation candle
- **Confirmation**: Final candle closes beyond Day 1's high/low
- **Stop Loss**: Below/above consolidation range
- **Target**: Measure Day 1 range, project from breakout

**Psychology**:
Strong move followed by profit-taking and doubt, then trend resumes as participants realize trend is still intact.

### 5. 三兵 San-pei / San-hei (Three Soldiers / Three Crows)

**Type**: Strong Trend Continuation/Reversal  
**Western Equivalent**: Three White Soldiers / Three Black Crows

**Description**:
Three consecutive candles of the same color with progressively higher closes (bullish) or lower closes (bearish), indicating strong momentum.

**Pattern Variations**:

#### 5a. 赤三兵 (Aka Sanpei / Three White Soldiers)
```
   /\
  /  \
 /\  /\
/  \/  \
  Day1 Day2 Day3
```
- Three bullish candles
- Each opens within previous body
- Each closes higher than previous
- Little to no upper wicks

 \/  \/
  \  /
   \/
Day1 Day2 Day3

- Each closes lower than previous
- Little to no lower wicks
- **Signal**: Strong bearish momentum

#### 5c. Advanced Formations:
- **思案星 (Shian Boshi / Deliberation)**: Third soldier is smaller with long upper wick — potential exhaustion
- **先詰まり (Sakizumari / Advance Block)**: Progressively smaller soldiers with longer wicks — weakening momentum

**Trading Rules**:
- **Entry**: On second or third soldier
- **Confirmation**: Steady progression, no long wicks
- **Warning Signs**: 
  - Decreasing body size
  - Increasing wicks
  - Gaps between candles
- **Stop Loss**: Below/above the first soldier

**Psychology**:
Sustained buying (or selling) pressure over three consecutive periods indicates conviction and institutional participation.

## Implementing Sakata Methods in Modern Trading

### For Cryptocurrency Markets

**Advantages**:
- ✅ 24/7 markets show clear patterns
- ✅ High volatility creates distinct candles
- ✅ Gaps occur during low liquidity periods
- ✅ Psychology principles still apply

**Challenges**:
- ⚠️ Fewer traditional "gaps" (24/7 trading)
- ⚠️ High noise on lower timeframes
- ⚠️ Need to adapt gap analysis for continuous markets

**Adaptations for Crypto**:
1. **Gaps**: Look for "Fair Value Gaps" (FVG) or rapid price jumps
2. **Timeframes**: Use 4H-1D for clearer patterns
3. **Confirmation**: Combine with volume and order flow
4. **Context**: Consider Bitcoin dominance and market-wide trends

## Integration with Modern Technical Analysis

### Complementary Methods

**Sakata + ICT/SMC**:
- San-zan/San-sen = Order Block patterns
- Gaps = Fair Value Gaps, Liquidity Voids
- Three Methods = Consolidation before Break of Structure

**Sakata + Western Candlesticks**:
- Three Mountains/Rivers = Multiple timeframe support/resistance
- Three Soldiers/Crows = Strong momentum confirmation
- Gaps = Breakaway validation for trend change

**Sakata + Volume Analysis**:
- Breakaway gaps need volume
- Exhaustion gaps show volume climax
- Three Methods show volume decrease during consolidation
