# GitHub Actions Workflow - Debug Symbols Integration

## Overview

The Android build workflow has been updated to automatically collect native debug symbols alongside the AAB file, making Play Store deployment simpler and more reliable.

## What Changed

### Workflow Enhancement
Added automatic collection of native debug symbols in the GitHub Actions Android build workflow (`.github/workflows/android-build.yml`).

### Before
When running the workflow with `build_type: release`, you got:
- ✅ `zikalyze-release-apk` (APK for testing)
- ✅ `zikalyze-release-aab` (AAB for Play Store)
- ❌ Debug symbols (missing - had to build locally)

### After
When running the workflow with `build_type: release`, you now get:
- ✅ `zikalyze-release-apk` (APK for testing)
- ✅ `zikalyze-release-aab` (AAB for Play Store)
- ✅ `zikalyze-native-debug-symbols` (debug symbols ZIP) ⭐ **NEW**

## How to Use

### Step 1: Trigger the Workflow

1. Go to: https://github.com/vicisaac48-eng/zikalyze/actions/workflows/android-build.yml
2. Click **"Run workflow"**
3. Select branch: `main`
4. Select build type: `release`
5. Click **"Run workflow"**

### Step 2: Wait for Build (5-10 minutes)

The workflow will:
1. Build web assets (`npm run build`)
2. Sync to Android (`npx cap sync android`)
3. Build release APK (`./gradlew assembleRelease`)
4. Build release AAB (`./gradlew bundleRelease`) ← **This also generates debug symbols**
5. Upload three artifacts to GitHub

### Step 3: Download Artifacts

Scroll to the **Artifacts** section at the bottom of the workflow run page:

1. **Download zikalyze-release-aab.zip**
   - Contains: `app-release.aab` (unsigned)
   - Size: ~10-30 MB

2. **Download zikalyze-native-debug-symbols.zip** ⭐ **NEW**
   - Contains: `native-debug-symbols.zip`
   - Size: ~5-15 MB
   - This is the file Play Store needs!

3. (Optional) Download zikalyze-release-apk.zip
   - Contains: `app-release-unsigned.apk`
   - For testing on device before Play Store upload

### Step 4: Sign the AAB

```bash
# Extract the AAB from the downloaded zip
unzip zikalyze-release-aab.zip

# Sign the AAB with your keystore
./scripts/auto_sign_aab.sh

# Debug symbols don't need signing - use as-is
```

### Step 5: Upload to Play Store

1. Go to [Google Play Console](https://play.google.com/console)
2. Navigate to: Your App → Release → Production (or Testing)
3. Click "Create new release"
4. **Upload the signed AAB** (e.g., `app-release-signed.aab`)
5. **Upload the debug symbols ZIP** (from the downloaded artifact)
   - Look for "Native debug symbols" section
   - Upload the `native-debug-symbols.zip` file directly
6. Add release notes
7. Submit for review

## Workflow Summary Output

When the workflow completes, you'll see a summary like this:

```
📱 Android Build Summary

| Property     | Value    |
|--------------|----------|
| Build Type   | release  |
| Triggered By | username |
| Commit       | abc1234  |

📥 Download Instructions

1. Scroll down to the Artifacts section below
2. Download zikalyze-release-aab for Play Store upload
3. Download zikalyze-native-debug-symbols (required by Play Store)
4. Upload BOTH files to Google Play Console

⚠️ Important: Play Store requires both AAB and debug symbols to avoid warnings
```

## Benefits

### ✅ Automation
- One workflow run produces everything needed for Play Store
- No need to run local builds just for debug symbols
- Consistent environment (GitHub Actions runner)

### ✅ Convenience
- Both files available in one place (workflow artifacts)
- 30-day retention for both AAB and debug symbols
- Can share workflow run link with team members

### ✅ Reliability
- Can't forget to generate debug symbols
- Workflow summary reminds you to download both
- Clear warnings about Play Store requirements

### ✅ Consistency
- Same build process for every release
- Reproducible builds with version tracking
- All artifacts tied to specific commit SHA

## Technical Details

### Artifact Upload Configuration

```yaml
- name: Upload Native Debug Symbols
  if: github.event.inputs.build_type == 'release'
  uses: actions/upload-artifact@v4
  with:
    name: zikalyze-native-debug-symbols
    path: android/app/build/outputs/native-debug-symbols/release/native-debug-symbols.zip
    retention-days: 30
```

### Build Output Locations

After `./gradlew bundleRelease`, these files are created:

```
android/app/build/outputs/
├── bundle/release/
│   └── app-release.aab                                    ← Uploaded as zikalyze-release-aab
├── native-debug-symbols/release/
│   └── native-debug-symbols.zip                           ← Uploaded as zikalyze-native-debug-symbols
└── apk/release/
    └── app-release-unsigned.apk                           ← Uploaded as zikalyze-release-apk
```

### Artifact Naming

| Workflow Artifact Name          | Contains                    | Purpose                        |
|--------------------------------|----------------------------|--------------------------------|
| zikalyze-release-apk           | app-release-unsigned.apk   | Testing on device             |
| zikalyze-release-aab           | app-release.aab            | Play Store upload (after signing) |
| zikalyze-native-debug-symbols  | native-debug-symbols.zip   | Play Store debug symbol upload |

## Troubleshooting

### Artifact Not Found

**Problem:** `zikalyze-native-debug-symbols` artifact is missing

**Causes:**
- Workflow was run with `build_type: debug` (debug symbols only for release)
- Workflow failed before upload step
- Old workflow version (before this update)

**Solution:**
1. Re-run workflow with `build_type: release`
2. Check workflow logs for build errors
3. Ensure workflow file is up to date with latest changes

### Wrong File in Artifact

**Problem:** Downloaded artifact doesn't contain `native-debug-symbols.zip`

**Causes:**
- Downloaded wrong artifact (e.g., downloaded AAB instead of symbols)
- Artifact zip not extracted

**Solution:**
1. Verify you downloaded `zikalyze-native-debug-symbols.zip`
2. Extract the outer zip to reveal `native-debug-symbols.zip` inside
3. Upload the inner `native-debug-symbols.zip` to Play Store

### Upload Rejected by Play Store

**Problem:** Play Console rejects the debug symbols file

**Causes:**
- Version code mismatch between AAB and symbols
- Symbols from different build than AAB

**Solution:**
1. Download both AAB and symbols from the same workflow run
2. Ensure version codes match
3. Don't mix artifacts from different builds

## Best Practices

### 1. Always Use the Same Workflow Run
- Download AAB and debug symbols from the same workflow run
- Don't mix files from different builds
- Version codes must match exactly

### 2. Keep Workflow Artifacts
- GitHub retains artifacts for 30 days
- After 30 days, keep local copies if needed
- Store workflow run URL for reference

### 3. Verify Before Upload
```bash
# Check AAB version
unzip -p zikalyze-release-aab.zip app-release.aab | grep versionCode

# Verify debug symbols exist
unzip -l zikalyze-native-debug-symbols.zip
```

### 4. Document Your Process
- Note workflow run URL in release notes
- Track which commit SHA produced each release
- Keep mapping of Play Store version → workflow run
