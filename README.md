## 📊 AI Accuracy & Transparency

We believe in honest, transparent communication about our AI capabilities. For a detailed comparison of Zikalyze AI vs. major AI systems (OpenAI GPT-4, xAI Grok, Anthropic Claude, etc.), see our [Honest AI Accuracy Assessment](./docs/AI_ACCURACY_ASSESSMENT.md).

**Key Points:**
- Zikalyze is a **specialized algorithmic analysis engine**, not a general-purpose LLM
- Uses proven trading methodologies (ICT/SMC, multi-timeframe confluence)
- 100% client-side, deterministic, and privacy-preserving
- Honest about limitations — no guaranteed profits, no magic predictions
